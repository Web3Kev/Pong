This a version of pong you play with your hands, against yourself or someone else (make sure uses a left hand and the other a right hand).

Once you've allowed your camera, you can make a "victory sign" ✌️ ✌️ with both hands , in order to start the game.

move your hands up and down ✋ and rotate to rotate the paddle. To throw the ball, make a "victory sign" ✌️.
Each top and bottom screen bounce speeds up the ball.
